Proprietary Software License

Version 1.0

Preamble

The Proprietary Software License is crafted to ensure maximum control over the software by the copyright holder and to minimize the rights and freedoms of users. Unlike licenses that encourage sharing and modification, this license restricts the use, modification, and distribution of the software to protect the proprietary interests of its owner. By using this software, you agree to abide by these stringent terms, which prioritize restriction over openness.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions

	•	“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.
	•	“You” refers to the licensee, the individual or entity bound by these terms.
	•	“The Copyright Holder” refers to the entity that owns the copyright to the Program.

1. Restricted Use

You are permitted to use the Program solely for personal, non-commercial purposes as defined by the Copyright Holder. Any use beyond this—such as commercial, educational, or competitive purposes—is strictly prohibited unless you obtain a separate, written license from the Copyright Holder, which may involve additional fees at their discretion.

2. Prohibition on Modification

You may not modify, adapt, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or create derivative works based on the Program. The source code is not provided and is considered a confidential trade secret of the Copyright Holder. Any attempt to access, alter, or replicate the Program’s functionality violates this License and may result in legal action.

3. No Distribution

You are forbidden from distributing, sharing, lending, or otherwise transferring copies of the Program to any other individual or entity. Each user must acquire their own unique license directly from the Copyright Holder. Sharing the Program in any form—whether physical, digital, or via a network—is expressly prohibited.

4. No Redistribution of Modified Versions

Since modification of the Program is not permitted, redistribution of any modified version is also strictly forbidden. This clause reinforces that even if modification were hypothetically allowed, you would have no right to share or distribute such changes.

5. Termination

Your rights under this License will terminate immediately and automatically upon any violation of these terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use of the Program and destroy all copies in your possession, whether digital or physical. The Copyright Holder reserves the right to pursue damages or injunctive relief for any breach.

6. No Warranty

The Program is provided “as is,” with no warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. The Copyright Holder bears no liability for any damages—direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential—arising from your use or inability to use the Program. All risks are solely yours.

7. No Support

The Copyright Holder is not obligated to provide any support, updates, patches, or maintenance for the Program. Any such services, if offered, are at the Copyright Holder’s sole discretion and may incur additional costs.

8. Governing Law

This License is governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Copyright Holder is based. Any disputes arising under this License must be resolved in the courts of that jurisdiction, and you agree to submit to its exclusive authority.

9. Acceptance

By installing, accessing, or using the Program, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by these terms. If you do not agree, you must not use the Program and must destroy any copies in your possession.
