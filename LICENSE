Proprietary Software LicenseVersion 1.0

Preamble

The Proprietary Software License is crafted to ensure maximum control over the software by the copyright holder and to minimize the rights and freedoms of users. Unlike licenses that encourage sharing and modification, this license restricts the use, modification, and distribution of the software to protect the proprietary interests of its owner. By using Backdoor App Signer, you agree to abide by these stringent terms, which prioritize restriction over openness.
